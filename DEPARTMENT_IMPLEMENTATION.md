# Department-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive department-based access control for the Overland PM system. When team members like Fatma from the Tracking department log in, they will only see data related to their department, creating a professional and focused work environment.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. My Department Dashboard (`/my_department`)
- **Comprehensive KPI Display**: Shows department-specific statistics including:
  - Active projects with success rate
  - Task completion metrics (pending, in progress, completed)
  - Team member count and performance
  - Department-specific completion rates

- **Recent Activities Timeline**: Displays recent department activities with icons and timestamps

- **Upcoming Deadlines**: Shows tasks with approaching deadlines, color-coded by urgency:
  - Red: 1 day or less
  - Yellow: 2-3 days  
  - Blue: 4-7 days
  - Green: More than 7 days

- **Department Announcements**: Displays announcements targeted to the specific department

- **Team Performance Metrics**: Shows top 5 performers with completion rates and task counts

### 2. Department Scoping Across All Modules

#### Projects
- Projects listing automatically filtered by user's department
- Only projects assigned to user's department are visible
- Project dropdowns in other modules respect department scoping

#### Tasks

### 3. Navigation Enhancements

### 4. Access Control Architecture

- Forbidden redirects for unauthorized department access
- Session-based department switching with access verification

### 5. User Experience Improvements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Controllers
- `app/Controllers/My_department.php` - Main department dashboard controller

#### New Views
- `app/Views/my_department/index.php` - Dashboard with KPIs and widgets
- `app/Views/my_department/no_department.php` - Empty state for unassigned users
- `app/Views/my_department/topbar_widget.php` - Header department selector

#### Enhanced Controllers
- `app/Controllers/Tasks.php` - Added automatic department filtering
- `app/Controllers/Departments.php` - Enhanced access controls for department pages
- `app/Libraries/Left_menu.php` - Added "My Department" menu item

#### Enhanced Views
- `app/Views/includes/topbar.php` - Added department widget integration

#### Language Support
- Added 20+ new language keys for department features
- Support for department switching, dashboard labels, and status messages

### Database Integration
- Utilizes existing department relationship tables
- No schema changes required
- Leverages `user_departments`, `departments`, and related foreign keys

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient department lookup with caching in base controller
- Minimal database queries through reuse of accessible department arrays
- Session storage for department preferences to reduce repeated lookups

## Usage Examples

### For Department Members (like Fatma from Tracking)
1. **Login Experience**: After login, sees "My Department" in sidebar
2. **Dashboard Access**: `/my_department` shows Tracking department KPIs
3. **Filtered Data**: All projects, tasks, team members filtered to Tracking only
4. **Announcements**: Only sees announcements for Tracking or company-wide
5. **Department Pages**: Can view `/departments/view/tracking_id` but only sees Tracking data

### For Multi-Department Managers
1. **Department Switching**: Topbar widget allows switching between departments
2. **Session Persistence**: Selected department persists across page loads  
3. **Comprehensive Access**: Can switch context to manage different departments

### For Administrators
1. **Full Access**: Sees all data across all departments
2. **Department Management**: Access to full department CRUD operations
3. **User Assignment**: Can assign users to departments and manage access

## Security & Access Control

### Automatic Filtering
- All `list_data()` methods automatically apply department filters for non-admins
- Model `get_details()` calls include department scoping options
- Project dropdowns filtered to accessible departments

### Permission Checks
- Department page access requires membership verification
- Read-only access to department information for members
- Management operations restricted to admins and department managers

### Data Isolation
- Users cannot access data from departments they don't belong to
- URL manipulation protected by access checks
- Department switching validated against user permissions

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Additions
1. **Department Reports**: Detailed analytics and performance reports
2. **Department Notifications**: Real-time notifications for department events
3. **Workflow Integration**: Department-specific workflow approvals
4. **Resource Management**: Department-based resource allocation and tracking
5. **Cross-Department Collaboration**: Controlled sharing between departments

### Integration Points
- **File Management**: Department-specific file organization
- **Time Tracking**: Department-based time reporting
- **Expense Management**: Department budget tracking
- **Client Assignment**: Department-specific client relationships

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Login as Fatma (Tracking)**: Verify only Tracking data visible
2. **Department Switching**: Test multi-department user experience
3. **Access Control**: Attempt to access other department URLs (should be blocked)
4. **Empty State**: Test user with no department assignment
5. **Admin Override**: Verify admins still see all data

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for department filtering methods
- Integration tests for access control
- Performance tests for dashboard queries

## Conclusion

This implementation transforms the Overland PM system into a professional, department-focused platform where users like Fatma see only relevant data for their department. The comprehensive scoping, intuitive navigation, and professional UI create an efficient work environment while maintaining strong security boundaries between departments.

The modular design allows for easy extension and maintenance, while the session-based department switching provides flexibility for users who need to work across multiple departments.
