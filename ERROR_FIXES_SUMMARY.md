# Department System Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing View File Error
**Error:** `Invalid file: "my_department/topbar_widget.php"`
**Cause:** The topbar widget file was not created in the initial implementation
**Fix:** Created the missing `app/Views/my_department/topbar_widget.php` file

### 2. Undefined Method Error
**Error:** `Call to undefined method App\Models\User_departments_model::get_user_departments`
**Cause:** The topbar widget was calling a non-existent method
**Fix:** Updated the widget to use the correct method `get_user_departments_with_details()`

### 3. PHP Syntax Error
**Error:** `syntax error, unexpected token "<", expecting end of file`
**Cause:** Duplicate PHP opening tags in the topbar widget file
**Fix:** Cleaned up the PHP syntax and removed duplicate opening tags

### 4. Missing Helper Function Error
**Error:** `Call to undefined function character_limiter()`
**Cause:** The text helper was not loaded in the view files
**Fix:** Added `helper('text');` at the beginning of both widget files

## Files Modified

1. **app/Views/my_department/topbar_widget.php**
   - Fixed method call from `get_user_departments()` to `get_user_departments_with_details()`
