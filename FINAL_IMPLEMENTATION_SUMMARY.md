# Final Department System Implementation Summary

## âœ… All Critical Errors Resolved

The department-based access control system is now fully functional and error-free. All CRITICAL runtime errors have been successfully resolved.

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. Left_menu.php Method Error
**Error:** `Call to undefined method App\Models\User_departments_model::get_user_departments`
**Root Cause:** The Left_menu library was calling `get_user_departments()` on the wrong model
**Solution:** Changed to use `Departments_model->get_user_departments()` which is the correct method

### 2. Tasks Model Department Filtering
**Error:** Incorrect method call `add_department_filter_to_options()` in Tasks controller
**Root Cause:** Method didn't exist, causing filtering to fail
**Solution:** Implemented proper department filtering directly in the Tasks controller using existing Tasks_model `department_ids` support

### 3. My_department Controller Data Type Error
**Error:** `Call to a member function getResult() on array`
**Root Cause:** Tasks_model `get_details()` returns different data types based on whether `limit` parameter is provided
**Solution:** Added proper data type handling to work with both array and query result object returns
