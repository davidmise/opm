# Announcement Management System - Fixes Complete

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed All Announcements Tab Display ✅
**Issue**: The All Announcements tab wasn't showing all announcements properly
**Solution**: 
- Updated `announcements()` controller method to show ALL announcements for admin users
- For staff users, properly filter by their department access
- Announcements table now displays correct counts and pagination

### 2. Fixed Tab-Specific Data Display ✅
**Issue**: Each tab wasn't showing the data it's supposed to show
**Solution**:
- **All Announcements Tab**: Shows all announcements with proper filtering
- **Department Targeted Tab**: Groups announcements by department with visual department indicators
- **Templates Tab**: Shows announcement templates (when available)
- **Analytics Tab**: Placeholder for future analytics (when implemented)

### 3. Fixed Dynamic Data Display in Announcements Table ✅
**Issue**: Category and priority columns showed hardcoded 'General' and 'Normal' values
**Solution**:
- Now displays actual category values from announcement data:
  - `general` → General (blue badge)
  - `urgent` → Urgent (red badge)
  - `policy` → Policy (yellow badge)
  - `event` → Event (gray badge)
- Now displays actual priority values:
  - `low` → Low (gray badge)
  - `normal` → Normal (blue badge)
  - `high` → High (yellow badge)
  - `urgent` → Urgent (red badge)

### 4. Implemented Action Button Handlers ✅
**Issue**: Action buttons (View, Edit, Duplicate, Delete) were non-functional
**Solution**: Added JavaScript event handlers for:

#### View Button
- Displays announcement details (info message for now)
- Ready for modal expansion

#### Edit Button
- Fetches announcement data via AJAX
- Populates form fields
- Opens modal for editing
- Endpoint: `GET /departments/get_announcement_data`

#### Duplicate Button
- Creates a copy of the announcement with "(Copy)" suffix
- Maintains all original properties (category, priority, departments, dates)
- Creates new record with updated creator and date
- Endpoint: `POST /departments/duplicate_announcement`

#### Delete Button
- Soft deletes announcement (marks as deleted in database)
- Requires confirmation
- Reloads page on success
- Endpoint: `POST /departments/delete_announcement`

### 5. Created Missing Controller Endpoints ✅

#### `get_announcement_data`
```
POST /departments/get_announcement_data
Input: id (announcement ID)
Output: JSON with announcement data
Returns: Success with announcement object or error
```

#### `duplicate_announcement`
```
POST /departments/duplicate_announcement
Input: id (announcement ID)
Output: JSON with success/error message
Creates: New announcement with all properties copied
```

#### `delete_announcement`
```
POST /departments/delete_announcement
Input: id (announcement ID)
Output: JSON with success/error message
Action: Soft deletes announcement (sets deleted flag)
```

### 6. Admin vs Staff Visibility ✅
**Admin Users**:
- See ALL announcements in the management interface
- No filtering applied
- Full control over all announcements

**Staff Users**:
- See only announcements they have access to:
  - Global announcements (shared with all_members)
  - Announcements targeted to their departments
  - Announcements targeted directly to them
- Cannot see announcements for other departments
