# Announcement Filters Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Department Filter 500 Error
**Problem:** When filtering by department, a 500 Internal Server Error occurred with the message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toSvg')" in the browser console.

**Root Cause:** The `get_filtered_announcements()` method in `Departments.php` had duplicate logic that called `$this->Announcements_model->get_details()` twice with the same parameters, causing the filtering logic to be executed redundantly and causing undefined variable states.

**Solution:** 
- Removed all duplicate filtering logic
- Consolidated the method to call `get_details()` only once
- Properly structured the filtering flow: get results → apply global filter if needed → apply department filter → apply category/priority filters

### 2. Category/Priority Filters Not Working
**Problem:** When selecting a category or priority filter, nothing happened - the announcements table didn't change.

**Root Cause:** The filters were configured to use DataTable's `.draw()` method, but DataTable wasn't properly initialized with custom search functions for category and priority filtering.

**Solution:**
- Created a unified `loadAnnouncementsByFilters()` function that accepts all three filter parameters (department_id, category, priority)
- Updated the JavaScript filter change handlers to call this new function with all three filter values
- The function makes a single AJAX call to `get_filtered_announcements()` passing all parameters
- The backend now properly handles all three filters simultaneously

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/Controllers/Departments.php`
**Method:** `get_filtered_announcements()` (lines ~390-520)

**Changes:**
- Added `$category_filter` and `$priority_filter` parameter extraction from POST data
- Removed duplicate `$this->Announcements_model->get_details()` calls
- Added proper category filtering using `array_filter()`
- Added proper priority filtering using `array_filter()`
- Enhanced HTML output to use dynamic category/priority values instead of hardcoded "general"/"normal"
- Added proper data attributes to action buttons for JavaScript handlers

**Key Code:**
```php
// Extract all filter parameters
$category_filter = $this->request->getPost('category');
$priority_filter = $this->request->getPost('priority');

// Apply category filter
if (!empty($category_filter)) {
    $announcements = array_filter($announcements, function($announcement) use ($category_filter) {
        $cat = isset($announcement->category) ? $announcement->category : 'general';
        return $cat === $category_filter;
    });
}

// Apply priority filter
if (!empty($priority_filter)) {
    $announcements = array_filter($announcements, function($announcement) use ($priority_filter) {
        $pri = isset($announcement->priority) ? $announcement->priority : 'normal';
        return $pri === $priority_filter;
    });
}
```

### 2. `app/Views/departments/announcements.php`
**JavaScript Section:** Filter event handlers and AJAX functions (lines ~680-750)

**Changes:**
- Consolidated all three filter change handlers into a single `on('change')` handler for all filters
- Each filter change now calls `loadAnnouncementsByFilters()` with all three filter values
- Replaced `loadAnnouncementsByDepartment()` with new `loadAnnouncementsByFilters()` function
- Enhanced AJAX call to pass category, priority, and department_id together
- Improved error handling with better error message extraction from AJAX response
- Better loading indicator with Bootstrap spinner instead of Font Awesome icon

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// All filters trigger the same function with all parameters
$('#filter-category, #filter-priority, #filter-department').on('change', function() {
    var category = $('#filter-category').val();
    var priority = $('#filter-priority').val();
    var department = $('#filter-department').val();
    loadAnnouncementsByFilters(department, category, priority);
});

function loadAnnouncementsByFilters(department_id, category, priority) {
    $.ajax({
        url: '<?php echo base_url("index.php/departments/get_filtered_announcements"); ?>',
        type: 'POST',
        data: {
            department_id: department_id || 0,
            category: category || '',
            priority: priority || ''
        },
        // ...
    });
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open departments/announcements page
- [ ] Create test announcements with different categories:
  - [ ] General category
  - [ ] Urgent category
  - [ ] Policy category
  - [ ] Event category
- [ ] Create test announcements with different priorities:
  - [ ] Low priority
  - [ ] Normal priority (default)
  - [ ] High priority
  - [ ] Urgent priority
- [ ] Test category filter - select each category and verify correct announcements display
- [ ] Test priority filter - select each priority and verify correct announcements display
- [ ] Test department filter - select each department and verify correct announcements display
- [ ] Test combining filters:
  - [ ] Department + Category
  - [ ] Department + Priority
  - [ ] Category + Priority
  - [ ] All three filters together
- [ ] Verify feather icons are rendered correctly after filtering
- [ ] Verify action buttons (View, Edit, Duplicate, Delete) work after filtering
- [ ] Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify no 500 errors occur when filtering

## Technical Details

### Filter Processing Order
1. Admin vs. Staff differentiation - admin sees all, staff gets filtered results
2. Department filtering (if specified)
3. Global announcement filtering (if "global" option selected)
4. Category filtering (if specified)
5. Priority filtering (if specified)

### Dynamic Badge Colors
The backend now generates proper badge classes based on actual values:

**Category Badges:**
- `urgent` → `bg-danger` (red)
- `policy` → `bg-warning` (yellow)
- `event` → `bg-secondary` (gray)
- `general` (default) → `bg-info` (blue)

**Priority Badges:**
- `high` → `bg-warning` (yellow)
- `urgent` → `bg-danger` (red)
- `low` → `bg-secondary` (gray)
- `normal` (default) → `bg-info` (blue)

### AJAX Endpoint
**URL:** `/index.php/departments/get_filtered_announcements`
**Method:** POST
**Parameters:**
- `department_id` (int) - Department ID to filter by, 0 for all, "global" for global only
- `category` (string) - Category to filter by (empty for all)
- `priority` (string) - Priority to filter by (empty for all)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "html": "<tr>...</tr><tr>...</tr>",
  "count": 5
}
```

## Known Limitations

- Search/text filter still uses client-side DataTable search (no AJAX)
- Combining all three filters with large datasets may be slow
- Future enhancement: Add full-text search capability via AJAX

## Future Enhancements

1. Add search filter via AJAX
2. Add sort by date/title/status
3. Add pagination for large result sets
4. Add bulk actions (delete multiple, export, etc.)
5. Add scheduled announcement preview
6. Add announcement history/versioning
