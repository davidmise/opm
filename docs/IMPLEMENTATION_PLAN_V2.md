## üìã Tasks Breakdown

### Phase 1: Fix Department Dropdown (Priority: HIGH)
**Current Issue:** Dropdown shows numbers (0, 1, 2, 6) instead of department names in screenshot

**Root Cause:** The `get_departments_dropdown()` returns Select2 format with "id" and "text" keys, but `form_dropdown()` expects simple key-value pairs.

**Solution:**
- [ ] Modify `Departments_model->get_departments_dropdown()` to return two formats
- [ ] Use `appDropdown()` jQuery plugin for AJAX-enabled dropdown (like clients)
- [ ] Update Projects and Team Members views to use new format

**Files to Modify:**
1. `app/Models/Departments_model.php` - Add `get_departments_dropdown_simple()` method
2. `app/Views/projects/modal_form.php` - Use appDropdown for department field
3. `app/Views/team_members/job_info.php` - Use appDropdown for department field
4. `app/Controllers/Projects.php` - Pass dropdown in correct format
5. `app/Controllers/Team_members.php` - Pass dropdown in correct format

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Phase 2: Add Edit Functionality (Priority: HIGH)
**Current Issue:** Edit links exist but need to be more prominent

**Solution:**
- [ ] Verify modal edit is working
- [ ] Add edit icon in department name cell
- [ ] Test edit form with all fields
- [ ] Ensure color picker works in edit mode

**Files to Verify:**
1. `app/Controllers/Departments.php` - `modal_form()` method
2. `app/Views/departments/modal_form.php` - Form handles edit mode
3. `app/Views/departments/index.php` - Edit links properly configured

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

---

### Phase 3: Add Sidebar Navigation (Priority: HIGH)
**Current Issue:** No "Departments" menu in sidebar

**Solution:**
- [ ] Add departments menu item to Left_menu.php library
- [ ] Position under "Team" section or as standalone
- [ ] Add permission check (admin or can_manage_departments)
- [ ] Add proper icon (layers, grid, or package)

**Files to Modify:**
1. `app/Libraries/Left_menu.php` - Add departments menu item
2. Test navigation and active state highlighting

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

---

### Phase 4: Link Team Members with Departments (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current Issue:** No way to see which team members belong to a department

**Solution:**
- [ ] Create department detail/view page
- [ ] Show list of team members in that department
- [ ] Show list of projects in that department
- [ ] Add statistics dashboard
- [ ] Add quick actions (assign member, assign project)

**Files to Create/Modify:**
1. `app/Views/departments/view.php` - Department detail page
2. `app/Controllers/Departments.php` - Complete `view()` method
3. `app/Models/Departments_model.php` - Add `get_members()` method
4. `app/Models/Departments_model.php` - Add `get_projects()` method

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---

### Phase 5: Improve Statistics Display (Priority: LOW)
**Current Issue:** Statistics badges are basic

**Solution:**
- [ ] Add percentage indicators
- [ ] Add trend indicators (if tracking over time)
- [ ] Add color coding (green for high, yellow for medium, red for low)
- [ ] Add tooltips with more details

**Files to Modify:**
1. `app/Controllers/Departments.php` - `_make_row()` method
2. `app/Views/departments/index.php` - CSS improvements

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

## üìê Technical Specifications

### Department Dropdown Format

**Current (Broken):**
```php
// Returns Select2 format
[
    ["id" => "", "text" => "- Department -"],
    ["id" => "1", "text" => "General"],
    ["id" => "2", "text" => "Engineering"]
]
```

**New (Fixed):**
```php
// Method 1: Simple key-value for form_dropdown()
[
    "" => "- Department -",
    "1" => "General",
    "2" => "Engineering"
]

// Method 2: JSON for appDropdown() (preferred)
{
    "1": "General",
    "2": "Engineering",
    "3": "Marketing"
}
```

### Sidebar Menu Structure

**Location:** After "Team" section or standalone

**Code Structure:**
```php
if ($this->ci->login_user->is_admin || get_array_value($permissions, "can_manage_departments")) {
    $sidebar_menu["departments"] = array(
        "name" => "departments",
        "url" => "departments",
        "class" => "grid"
    );
}
```

**Icon Options:**
- `grid` - Grid icon
- `layers` - Layers icon
- `package` - Package icon

4. **Projects Tab** - List of projects with status
5. **Activity Tab** - Recent activity in department (future)
