## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Run database migration** on existing installation:
   ```sql
   SOURCE database_migrations/001_add_departments.sql;
   ```

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test the feature end-to-end:**
   - Create a department
   - Assign it to a team member
   - Assign it to a project
   - View statistics
   - Try to delete (should fail if has dependencies)

### Short Term (Recommended)
3. **Complete remaining documentation:**
   - User manual
   - Developer guide
   - System structure guide
   - Change log

4. **Add permission to roles UI** (if non-admin access needed)

5. **Add department filter to projects list page**

6. **Add department column to team members list**

### Long Term (Optional Enhancements)
7. **Department-based features:**
   - Department managers (assign a user as dept manager)
   - Department-specific reports
   - Department-based project visibility
   - Department budget tracking
   - Department performance metrics

8. **Additional views:**
   - Department detail page (show all members and projects)
   - Department analytics dashboard
   - Department comparison charts

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Permission not exposed in UI:** The `can_manage_departments` permission exists but isn't available in the roles/permissions interface yet. Currently admin-only.

2. **No department detail view:** The `view()` method in Departments controller is a skeleton and doesn't render a full detail page.

3. **No project filter:** Projects list doesn't have a department filter dropdown yet (easy to add).

4. **No team members list filter:** Team members list doesn't show department column or filter (easy to add).

5. **No migration rollback:** Migration script doesn't include a rollback/undo script.

6. **No soft delete restoration:** Once a department is deleted (soft), there's no UI to restore it.

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Department dropdown not showing
- **Solution:** Check that App_Controller loads Departments_model properly
- **Verify:** Look for `public $Departments_model;` and `'Departments_model'` in models array

**Issue:** Can't save department_id to team_member_job_info
- **Solution:** Verify migration ran successfully and column exists
- **Check:** `DESCRIBE opm_team_member_job_info;` should show department_id column

**Issue:** Can't delete department even when empty
- **Solution:** Check `has_dependencies()` logic and verify counts are 0
- **Debug:** Add error logging in delete method

**Issue:** Color picker not working
- **Solution:** Ensure Bootstrap and required JS libraries are loaded
- **Check:** Browser console for JavaScript errors

---

## Maintenance Notes

### Database
- Backup before running migration
- Test migration on staging environment first
- Monitor department table size (unlikely to grow large)

### Code
- All department-related code follows existing CodeIgniter 4 patterns
- No external dependencies added
- Compatible with existing CI4 upgrade path

### Future CI4 Updates
- Departments feature uses only stable CI4 APIs
- No deprecated methods used
- Should be compatible with future CI4 versions
